# Projects

Implementation of a Machine learning classifier, K-NN, aiming the problem of handwriting recognition with focus on numbers from 0 to 9. The data used for testing the classifier is from MNIST database and it is provided here also. The classifier was written in python and it was a project for the course of Machine Learning, University of Copenhagen 2018. 

Goal / Tasks:

1. Compare K-NN algorithms for K = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... , 33 in their ability to dis-
tinguish between digits 0 and 1.
2. Repeat the same for 0 and 8.
3. Repeat the same for 5 and 6.
